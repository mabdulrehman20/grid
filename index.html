        <P>There are many farms that raise animals, such as pigs, chickens, cows, etc. Non-organic farmers feed unhealthy diets to the animals. When animals are grown with antibiotics, the animals grow faster and earn more money. However, some people donâ€™t accept antibiotics in their body because they are allergic to it. When they eat, they will not feel well. Farmers should separate animals by their group size because they need more space for them to grow. Nevertheless, organic farmers have different ideas from non-organic farmers about growing their animals. In the day time, organic animals are living outside of the grassland to eat grass; that grass is natural and without any chemical.When the animals are eating grass their meat will taste different from the non-organic animals. Organic animals have a clean and shaded environment to live because they are living outside of the tent. When animals have a good and large environment, this will help protect animals from disease. When the animals live together, they defecate all around the floor. If animals have an illness, they will transfer it to other animals very fast when they are living there. Also, the farmer sells animals that have an illness. then the company will sell that meat to the market. </P>
